# scaling_image

Support for Scaling Images from 
[Android Vector Drawables](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/vector-drawable-resources).  By pre-processing
an SVG file into an AVD, static SVG files can be efficiently rendered.

The AVD format is informally specified
[here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/VectorDrawable),
including an informal mention of [SVG Path Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#TheDProperty).
