**Some Things to Check**

If your issue is an SVG asset that doesn't parse, or doesn't look the same as when viewed with a browser:
* Have you read the "Supported SVG Profile" and "Goals and Package Evolution" sections of the README?  Cliff notes summary:  Not all SVG files are *expected* to work.
* Have you checked your file to see if it's valid?  See, for example, https://validator.w3.org/
* Have you narrowed it down to a reasonably concise and small SVG file that reproduces the issue?

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.  If a rendering/parsing bug, be sure to include a copy of a reasonably small SVG that reproduces the issue.

**Additional context**
